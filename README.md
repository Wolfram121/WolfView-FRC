# WolfView

WolfView is a Java-based application for visualizing and recording telemetry data from a robot. It uses JavaFX for 3D visualization and NetworkTables for real-time communication.

## Features

- **Live Telemetry Mode**: Visualize real-time telemetry data from the robot.
- **Replay Mode**: Replay previously recorded telemetry data from JSON files.
- **Recording**: Save telemetry data to JSON files for later analysis.
- **3D Visualization**: View robot wheel telemetry in a 3D scene.
- **Keypad View**: Use the keypad (100% keyboard) to change views.
- **Custom View**: Use the arrow keys and bracket keys to move. This is relative to the bot.
- **Config**: config.json allows control of team # and other settings. Key "test" is to activate the sample WolfSend.java. Set to false if actually your bot is actually running. 

## Requirements

- Java 17 or higher (Tested on JDK 24)
- Gradle
